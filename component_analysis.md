# Frontend Component Analysis

This document provides an overview of the frontend components used in the application.

## File Structure

To begin our analysis, we need to understand the current file structure of the project. Here's what we know so far:

- The web application is located in the "gpt_engineer_enhanced_web" folder.
- The exact file structure within this folder is currently unknown.

## Next Steps

1. Identify the main entry point of the application (e.g., index.js, App.js, or main.js).
2. Analyze the routing structure (if any) to understand how different pages or views are organized.
3. Identify and describe key components used throughout the application.
4. Note any use of shadcn components and how they're integrated.
5. Analyze the state management approach (if any) used in the application.

As we gather more information about the file structure and components, we will update this document accordingly.
